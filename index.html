            <h1>CHESS</h1>
            <p>
                What is chess? Chess is one of the oldest and most popular board games.<br>
                It is played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, commonly white and black.<br>
                The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's king.

            The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time. The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to them, followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white queen on white, black queen on black), and the king on the remaining square.
            
            <aside>The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces.</aside>

            <p>Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over other pieces), and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured. Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important squares in the game.</p>

            <p>
                Athleticism is a blend of both skill and talent.<br>
                 Some elements, like speed and agility, may be innate to an individual, qualifying as talent.<br>
                 However, skills such as endurance, coordination, and strength often require deliberate training and practice to develop and improve.
